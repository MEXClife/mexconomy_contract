# MEXConomy

MEXConomy is a pure Peer-to-Peer Exchanger where all the private keys are kept
by the users themselves. This is to ensure that better control and confidence
can be kept by MEXConomy as people are getting jitter by the day, especially
when centralized exchangers can be just another 'Mt. Gox' in the making.
